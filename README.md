Spinning circles, hover effects, and ripple-like collisions bring colour, motion, and connection to life — all built with `p5.js`.

## How to Interact with our Artwork
1.	Hover your mouse over any wheel – the wheel will scale up smoothly.
2.	Nearby wheels will be pushed outward – creating a ripple effect.
3.	Each wheel spins continuously – with its own random speed.
4.	Refresh the page to get a brand-new colour combination.
